Learning objectives - "Implement the Visual Studio Code debugging tools for C#" section
In this module, you will:
 - Configure the Visual Studio Code debugger for a C# program.
 - Create breakpoints and step through your code to isolate issues.
 - Inspect your program state at any execution step.
 - Use the call stack to find the source of an exception.

Ultimately, you'll be able to isolate code bugs efficiently using the debugger tools, and you won't need to rely on Console.WriteLine anymore.
